should not be stored in the public domain, nor should the user's personal data be
be available to other persons. To save the necessary information, use

phone number (for sending messages); e-mail address; role (Administrator|| Advanced user| User).
Advanced user| User). Add, delete and edit information about the types of

Each operation in the system should be accompanied by logging, on the basis of which you can
Restore the database in case of loss of all data.
Suggest a security option (encryption/decryption) for the database and the logging system.
logging system.
During the development of a software product, the following methods of safe programming should be taken into account
programming - verification of input data and protection of user personal data.
The developed functionality should be tested using the unit tests framework.
The software should be placed on GitHub along with documentation (production
practice report), which contains a description of the system architecture (description of all developed components with UML
class diagrams)
